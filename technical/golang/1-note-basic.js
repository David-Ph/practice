/* 
go works in a similar way with C

in that you have to compile go program 
and in program you have to import package to do anything

? import 'fmt'
Package fmt implements formatted I/O with functions analogous to C's printf

? go build ./helloWorld.go
this is the command to compile go app
this will compile to something like .exe

? go run ./helloworld.go
this is something like npx nodemon helloworld.go
this is for development

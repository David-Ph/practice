# What is package in main?

Package is the project itself, or the project workspace
there are 2 types of packages
one is executable package, the other is reusable package
to create an executable package, we need to declare "package main" on the 1st line
if we declare anything else like "package something", it's a reusable package

executable package is a package that can be compiled and then executed. It also must have a func called main()

reusable package is a package that we can use as a halper tool, or we can put reusable code in there.

1. String Interpolation

Process of attaching other variables or values inside a string. Basically like a string literal in javascript

```
name = "Ben"
full_name = "#{name} Simmons"
full_name
```

```
"#{2 + 2} is the result"
```

2. String Concatenation

When you join 2 strings together

```
name = "Ben"
last_name = "Simmons"
full_name = name <> " " <> last_name
```

# What is Clean code?

- Clean code is about whether or not your code is easy to understand
- This is very important because a vast majority of a developer's time is spent reading and understanding code
- THere is not a single right way to write clean code
- Should be readable and meaningful
- should reduce cognitive load
- should be concise and to the point
- should be fun to write and to maintain
- should follow common best practices and patterns
- should avoid unintuitive names, complex nesting, and big code blocks

# Key Points: 

- Names: variables, functions, classes
- Structures & Comments: Code Formatting, good & bad comments
- Functions: Length, Parameters
- Conditionals & Error Handling: Deep nesting, missing error handling
- Classes & data structures: Missing distinction, bloated classes

? advantages of git
    - Nearly every operation is local
        You don't need internet connection to use git
    - git has integrity
        it's impossible to change the contents of any file without git knowing about it
    - git generally only adds data
        it is hard to get the system do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way. You can lose changes you havent committed, but after you commit a snapshot, it's very difficult to lose

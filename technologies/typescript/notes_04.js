/* 
* Dynamic vs Static types
javascript is a dynamically typed language, it means that types are resolved during runtime
typescript is a statically typed language, it means that types are resolved during compile time


* Classes static
static methods/properties are methods that can't be accessed from non static method inside the class.
To access static method/properties, you use ClassName.StaticMethod() or ClassName.StaticProperties from outside the class or static method.
if you're in a static method inside a class, you can use this instead
singleton pattern is where you want to make sure that a class can only be created once.
